      Apple has announced a new iPhone outside the month of September for the first time since 2016, and outside autumn for only the second time in a decade. It is a very big deal. It's the new iPhone SE for 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apple's popular first-gen iPhone SE was discontinued in September 2018, and fans of small, affordable handsets have been asking for a replacement ever since. At long last, they've got it - although it isn't quite as small this time around.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this article we have all the details about the new iPhone SE's release date (when you can pre-order, when it will appear in shops), price in the UK and US, specs, design and new features. We'll help you decide if this is the phone for you.

      <h3>
        Release date: When will the new iPhone SE come out?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The iPhone SE (2020) was announced at 4pm UK time on 15 April 2020. You'll be able to pre-order the new iPhone SE from 1pm UK time (or 5am PDT) on Friday 17 April, and it will be available in shops from Friday 24 April.

      <h3>
        Price: How much does the iPhone SE (2020) cost?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The iPhone SE (2020) starts at £419 in the UK, and $399 in the US. Yeah, that exchange rate bites just a bit. Here's the full pricing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          iPhone SE (2020, 64GB): £419/$399
        </li>
        <li>
          iPhone SE (2020, 128GB): £469/$449
        </li>
        <li>
          iPhone SE (2020, 256GB): £569/$549
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can check out your various buying options on Apple's site, although as mentioned above preorders haven't opened yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might be galling for UK readers to see prices that are higher in pounds than in dollars, but that's something we've grown used to since the launch of the original iPhone SE in 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
        And once you look past this, these are great prices. The new SE replaces the 8 and matches it in most respects, adding a processor that's two generations newer, but comes in at £60/£50 less at the base 64GB storage allocation. This is a phone launch that's all about value rather than excitement, which may be apt for the strange time we live in.

      <h3>
        iPhone SE (2020) design
      </h3>
      <p>
        The iPhone SE for 2020 takes its design cues from the iPhone 8 (it will reportedly fit into iPhone 8 cases), so this isn't a return to the ultra-compact 4in design of the iPhone SE (2016), nor do we get the squared-off corners of the iPad Pro range - both of which were touted, and in some cases demanded, in the run up to the launch.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's only a single camera lens on the rear, and it keeps the Home button - so Touch ID is the order of the day rather than Face ID.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some images of the new handset in all its glory:
